# Python Server

## Description
Main brain for parsing, computing and transmitting the navigation instructions to a Magic Leap device. To be used in conjunction with
`https://github.com/ernlavr/SPClient` for navigation and `https://github.com/ernlavr/SPMapping` for mapping and authoring an environment.

This project uses A* search algorithm to find the shortest path between two points in a 3D environment. The environment is represented
as a 3D voxel grid. The voxel grid is generated from an `.xml` scene description which itself is generated by the `SPMapping` project.

## To Run
1. Install MiniConda environment on your platform and create a new virtual environment
2. Create the virtual environment from the supplied environment.yml file `conda env create -f environment.yml`
3. Run the main.py script through your virtual environment

*Optionally* For visualization of TriMesh geometry you may need to add an additional dependency as a binary to your
$PATH environment variable. Download at

`main.py` is the main entry point of the software \
`requirements.txt` specifies all the 3rd party dependencies that this project relies on \
`res/` short for *resources*; contains any additional binaries that are necessary for temporary, local storage, i.e. scene description, etc. \
`permRes/` short for *permanent resources*; contains any additional resources that should come with the project, i.e. models or dummy-data \
`src/` short for *source*; location of the source code modules \
